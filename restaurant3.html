     <big> <b> The Information Technology boom in Bengaluru in the late 1990s converted Indiranagar
         and its two arterial roads (100 Feet Road and Chinmaya Mission Hospital Road) into a semi-commercial area. 
         Today, Indiranagar is an important residential and commercial hub of Bengaluru.[citation needed]</b></big>
